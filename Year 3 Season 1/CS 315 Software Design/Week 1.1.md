## Software Development Life Cycle (*aka SDLC*)
1) Requirements 
2) Design 
3) Development
4) Testing 
5) Deployment 
6) Maintenance

High Level Designs : System analyze and design(requirement and design)
Low Level

Development :
- Programming
- Data structure and algo
- OOP

Software design: low level design + SRS

SRS = Software Requirement Spec
SDA = Software design architecture

You design the testing and how the test are being tested
You also design the process/ standard deployment
You also design the maintenance

CICD = Continuouse Intergration Continuous Deployment 

## Analysis

High level design you can see all of the design and explain it in 1 picture

Mid level design is when you zoom in a component and explain it in detail how the component work (dynamic)

Low level design is very detailed, it doesn't involed software design, it involed with deployment. It talks about the backend. It's more about operation level.

## Scope of software engineering
### Background Process
1) Tracking control, Measure 
2) Risk managment & Quality assurance
3) Technical review
4) Configuration & Reusability management
5) Preparation and Production
