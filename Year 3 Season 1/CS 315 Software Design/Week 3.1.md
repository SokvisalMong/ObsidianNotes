# Basic Concept of Design

## What is Design?

A design is a plan or specfication for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the fom of a prototype, product or process.

## Basic Rules of Software Design

### Cause of difficulties in Software Development

- Complexity: Size, Intricacy, Volume of elements
- Conformity: Standards, Technology Limits
- Changeability: Specifications and business logics
- Invisibility: Design Errror

Intricacy - the complex interaction of elements with each other

### Design Error
- Incorrectness: User requirements not met
- Inconcsistency: No patterns
- Ambiguity: Wrong Interpretaions and assumptions
- Inferiority: Poor Quality (Inflexible & Inefficient)

Inflexible - Cannot adapt to changes
Inefficient - Takes too many resources and time to build

## Vehicles to overcome difficulties

1. The Axiom of seperation of concerns (Basically divide and conquer)
2. The Axiom of Comprehension
3. The Axiom of Translation (Change information from one to another without changing the content)
4. The Axiom of Transformation

Axiom - A statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. (Observed Truth but cannot be proven)

Axiom Example:
1. All humans beings have equal worth.
2. Constant repetition makes a habit
3. Practice makes Perfect
4. Drawing in paper or board makes it easier to understand or explain a process

## Principle of Design
1. The principle of Modular Design
2. The principle of portable designs
3. The principle of malleable designs
4. The principle of conceptual integrity
5. The principle of intellectual control
6. The principle of visualization
