When the design is modular, it allow designer to focus only on one things. If it is not modular, when we want to change something we will need all the designer. 

### Well structured
Well structured: it has the step, like what components need to be built first. Even though if the design has relationship but it does not reflect structure of the design.

### Simple
Simple: the design must be understandable, to the people who read it. If the design is too complex it may reduce the simplicity. Like the design should be understandable in less time.

### Efficient
Efficient: It means that our design should be efficient so that we can design it before the deadline. being able to determine/solve the problem very fast. If our design is simple but we hide the problems, then it is not efficient.

### Adequate
Adequate: the design should meet the requirements not less and not more. In reality, it is not commonly achievable, because the requirements keep changing till the last day.

### Flexibility
Flexibility: maybe a little bit related to Malleability. The different is, malleability means that when there is changes after the the building is complete, it still can be accommodates. The flexibility is that the design can be changed during the designing process.

### Practical
Practical: Each module in the design should provide the required facilities, neither more nor less.

Question: if book not applicable, how can we make sure our design is good, where can we get the guideline.
for platform, we don’t know about their design, how can we analyze it?

He said, 60% of the book is not applicable, only 40%.
