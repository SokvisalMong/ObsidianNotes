A Model is just a simplification of reality

A model is used to represent and objective in different perspectives, an example to follow or imitate, and being a well accepted engineering technique

### Types of learners

#### Visual/ Verbal Learner
Learns best in a written format (Readers)

#### Visual/ NonVerbal Learner
Learns best in a picture or design format (Image/Drawing)

#### Auditory/ Verbal Learner
Learns best in an oral language format (Listener)

#### Tactile/ Kinesthetic Learner
Learns best in a physically hands on activity (Hands-On)

Research found the most powerful method is visual/ nonverbal.

### Why model?

Model to better comprehend the complex systems

Better understand the system being developed

### Importance of modelling

4 aims to modeling:
- Helps visualize the system
- Specify the structure or behavior of the system
- Template that guides you in constructing the system
- Documenting decisions made

Software teams often don't model, they instead:
- Start coding from project requirements
- Work longer hours and write more code
- Lacks a planned architecture
- Doomed to fail

### Principles of modelling

There are 4 principles of modelling:
- The choice of model is important
- Levels of Precision may differ
- The Best models are connected to reality
- No single model is sufficient

#### The choice of model is important

THe model you create influences how the problem is attacked and how a solution is shaped

Models you choose will greatly affect your world view, with each world view having a different kind of system

#### Levels of precision may differ

Models can be expressed at different levels of precision.

The best ones let you choose your degree of detail depending on who is viewing the model and why they need to view it.

Example: For a client, the model may be just a preview of things
               For a designer, the model may be more indepth with specifications and details for building the model

#### The best models are connected to reality

The gap between the analysis model and the system's design model must be less.

Failing the bridge teh gap causes the system to diverge over time.

#### No single model is sufficient

A system is best when using small sets of nearly independent models.

Creating models that can be built and studied seperately but still interrelated

*Look into "4 + 1 view model" by Philippe Kruchten*

### What is UML?

UML is a language for:
- Visualizing
- Specifying
- Constructing
- Documenting

It is also the artifcats of a software-intensive system.

**Flowchart** is a procedural diagram representation of an algorithm step by step to solve a problem.

**UML** is a VIsual Modelling Language for describing software architecture and business problems.

Communication in the team will only happen when the team understands the model and system you are planning out.
Thus, the entire team need to understand the UML for everyone to be able to communicate in the team.
