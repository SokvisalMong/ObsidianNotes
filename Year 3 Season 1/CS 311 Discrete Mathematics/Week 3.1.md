# Set

*Use uppercase to denote a set*
*Use lowercase to denote an element*


## Ways to describe a set

### Roster Method
V = {a, e, i, o, u}
F = {apple, banana, orange}
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}

### Set Builder Notation

We characteize all elements by stating the properties they must have to be a memeber of the set.

For instance, the set O of all odd positive integers less than 10 can be written as

O = {x | x is an odd positive integer less than 10}

or specifying the universe as the set of positive integers as

O = {x &isin; &Zeta;<sup>+</sup> | x is odd and x < 10}

{&fnof;(x) | *P*(x)} is read as "The set of all elements &fnof; such that *P*(x) holds"
