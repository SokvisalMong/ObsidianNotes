# Set

A **set** is an unordered collection of objects, called elements or members of the set. A set is said to contain its elements.

a is an element of set A denoted by "a ∈ A".

a is not an element of set A denoted by "a ∉ A"

Thus, **set theory** is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with sets, applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics.

*Sets are denoted by Uppercase*
*Elements are denoted by Lowercase*

## Ways to describe a set

### Roster Method

V = {a, e, i, o, u}
P = {1, 2, 3, ..., 99}
F = {apple, orange, banana}

### Set builder notation

We use a set builder notation by characterizing all elements in a set by stating the properties they must have to be members.

Example:

set O of all positive integers less than 10
O = {x | x is an odd positive integer less than 10}

Sets are specified by writing
{f(x) | P(x)}
Where f(x) is a function of x and P(x) is a propositional function of x. The notation is read as "the set of all elements f(x) such that P(x) holds".

{ How elements look | Properties it satisfies }
*Pipe symbol | is short hand for such that*

### Equal Sets

2 sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements
Denoted as ∀x(x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B)

Example: {1, 3, 5} and {3, 5, 1} are equal and so are {1, 3, 3, 3} and {1, 3}

### Empty Sets

Empty sets or Null sets are denoted by { } or ∅.
The single element of the set { ∅ } is the empty set itself.

### Singleton Sets

Singleton set: a set with one element

### Subsets

Set A is a subset of B iff, every element of A is also an element of B
A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7} Thus, A ⊆ B

## Theoretic Operations

We use Theoretic Operations to build new sets from old ones.

Set Theoretic Operators are:
- Union (∪)
- Intersection (∩)
- Difference (−)
- Complement ("-", Written above the set):  ̅A
- Symmetric Difference (⊕)

### Union ∪

A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {2, 4, 5, 6}
A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4 ,5 ,6}

### Intersection ∩

A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {5, 7, 9}
A ∩ B = {5}

### Disjoint

if A and B have no common elements, they are disjoint
A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {2, 4, 6}
A ∩ B = ∅

### Disjoint Union ∪, with a dot on top or ⊔

If A and B are disjoint, the disjoint union is
A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {2, 4, 6}
A ⊔ B = {1, 2, 3, 4 ,5 ,6}

### Difference −

A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {5, 7, 9}
A − B = {1, 3}

### Symmetric Difference ⊕

A = {1, 3, 5}, B = {5, 7, 9}
A ⊕ B = {1, 3, 7, 9}

### Complement  ̅A

U = {1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 99}
A = {1, 2, 3}
̅A = {4, 5, 6, 7, ..., 99}
