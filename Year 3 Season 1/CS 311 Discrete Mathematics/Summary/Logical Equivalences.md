## Propositional Equivalences

### Tautology

**Tautology** is a compound proposition that is always true no the matter the truth value of the propositional variables in it.

### Contradiction

**Contradiction** is a compound proposition that is always false

### Contingency

**Contingency** is a compound proposition that is neither a tautology or contradiction.

## Logical Equivalences

The compount propositions p and q are called logically equivalent if p ↔ q is a tautology, denoted as p ≡ q.

## Satisfiability and Validity

#### Satisfiability

A compound proposition A = (p → q) ↔ (¬q → p) is satisifiable if and only if A is true for some interpretation.

The interpretation satisfying A is called a *model* for A.

#### Validity

A is valid, if A is true for all interpretations.

#### Unsatisfiability

A is unsatisfiable, if A is false for all interpretations.

#### Falsifiable

A is falsifiable, if A is false for some interpretations.

### Negations of Valid and Satisfiable Formulas

A is valid if and only if ¬A is unsatisfiable.
A is satisfiable if and only if ¬A is falsifiable.
